      <td><h4>This website gives users a brief overview of malware’s benign beginnings up to
 critical modern times. It generally accomplishes this by going through the most significant 
worms, viruses, and ransomware in chronological order. The website’s timeline begins in 
1966 when repeatable programs were simply that of a theory, but it then jumps to 1971 
when the first computer worm was created. From there on, the website formats its timeline
 based on the most notable malware created and the chaos it caused, up to 2016. 
Post 2016, the website briefly emphasizes the extent of malware as a critical issue 
in modern times. </h4></td>

      <td><h4>This website is similar to the previous one in the sense where it gives its 
users an overview on malware’s general history. However, unlike the previous website, it 
is not formatted like a timeline. Rather, it gives a more descriptive explanation of certain
 critical time periods; for instance: 1948-1971. This website does also touch upon critical 
malware released during this time period; however, it mentions several different critical 
malicious programs that the previous website failed to touch upon, such as the Code Red 
worm released in 2001. This website also goes more in depth on how malware advanced as 
both computers and–more specifically– the internet began to modernize.
