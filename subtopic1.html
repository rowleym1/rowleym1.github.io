Despite how complicated malware can be, this website describes the malware in ways that make it easily digestible 
for the reader. All of the subtopics contain at least one paragraph, but the majority contain at least two. 
The website discusses malware that is more basic and has been prominent for years–such as worms and viruses– 
but also talks about malware that has advanced to adjust to modern times– such as cryptojacking. 
After going through these malware attacks, the website provides a list of suggestions that a user can take 
advantage of in order to protect themselves from malware.

kinds of malware– though it discusses 12 different types instead of 13. However, the most critical difference 
between these two websites is that this website names a specific example of a real-life malware attack for each 
individual listed malware. For instance, the first type of malware discussed on this site is ransomware, and after 
a brief description, the site immediately follows with the example of RobbinHood, which was a type of ransomware 
that invaded the city of Baltimore. That being said, the descriptions of these types of malware are considerably 
more summarized than the previous site, but still sufficient enough for the user to comprehend.
